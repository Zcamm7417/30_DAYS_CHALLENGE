part 1
Studying the data I was giving, I opened the data in a read mode and striped it into groups of three, saving it as the "input_data".
Then i further strip the data of empty spaces and splitted it with double new line, saving it has variable "elves inventory".
I then, create a variable of mass_calories and elf with mass calories to be zero
Then I enumerate elves_inventory, starting from one so has to get accurate result. saving it into variable index and inventory
Then, I create an iteration with integer value calories through inventrory splitting inventory with new lines.
Then, gave a conditional statment that, if the calories is greater than the max calories that i saved to be zero, it should set the max calories to be that present calories.
And save the index

This will repeat till all the conditions are complete and return the max calories and the index of that max calories.

part 2
Here I want to the get the sum of the three highest calories.
After, studying the data, I gave a condiotional statement that, if calories is greater than 66000 it should append.
then, Sum them up.
