part 1
Read the data, strip it of new lines and splitted the data.
further splitting with ",", saving into variable start, second
further splitting into start, end with "-"
converting each item splitted to integer
further convertion to set, as i would want to access all the values within using range(start, end +1)
Then gave condition, if numberset first is a subset of number set second, count +1
then, print count


part 2
instructions have been updated that if a single value of first appear in second, count equal +1
